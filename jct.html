        <h1>Welcome Home to Jubilee</h1>
        <p>
          Every great story begins with a simple dream. Ours started with the belief that 
          coffee and tea aren't just beverages - they're moments of connection, comfort, and joy.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-size: 1.1rem; opacity: 0.9;">
          After nearly three decades, we're proud to continue the legacy my parents began with love, 
          dedication, and a homemade coffee cart that brought joy to communities across Alabama. 
          Now, my mother and I are working together to bring Jubilee back to life for a new generation.

                <h3>The Original Dream (1995)</h3>
                <p>Nearly 30 years ago, my parents started Jubilee Coffee & Tea with nothing but passion, a small mail-order business, and a homemade coffee cart. They brought the joy of exceptional coffee to local festivals and parades across Alabama, building relationships one cup at a time.</p>

                <h3>The Foundation They Built</h3>
                <p>With every festival, every parade, every carefully packaged mail order, my parents weren't just selling coffee - they were creating connections. They understood that great coffee brings people together, creates memories, and becomes part of family traditions.</p>
